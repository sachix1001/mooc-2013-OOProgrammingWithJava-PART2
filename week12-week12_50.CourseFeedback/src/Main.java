        This course was brilliant! I love the way you test exercises.
        It was easy to keep studying as the test code allways tells me what was wrong.
        There were a lot of exercises to help understand the learning materials.
        Only thing I would like you to add is how to write comment and javadoc.
        Thank you so much to provide such a excellent course.
